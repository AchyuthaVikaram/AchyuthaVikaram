## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a passionate **MERN Stack Developer** with a solid foundation in **Java** and a strong interest in **data structures and algorithms**. Over the past few years, I've built multiple full-stack applications. I have a knack for back-end development but am equally comfortable working across the entire tech stack.
I've solved **150+ DSA problems** on LeetCode using Java as Primary Language
I am also an aspiring **Google Summer of Code 2025** participant and have already started my preparations to contribute to open-source projects. 

## 🌱 What I'm Currently Learning

- **React** for building interactive frontends.
- **Machine Learning** for a project under **Konam Foundation**

## 💼 What I've Worked On

- **Trendify - Dress with Passion, Shop with Trendify**  
  A shopping platform featuring user accounts, wishlists, carts, and categorized products for men, women, and kids. Built with **Node.js**, **Express**, **SQL**, and frontend technologies like **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap**.

- **Wanderlust**  
  An Airbnb-like platform built using the **MERN stack**, complete with authentication, map integration, and reviews. This project showcases my skills in **MongoDB**, **Express**, **React**, and **Node.js**, as well as my deployment expertise with **Render**.


## 🎯 Goals

- **Crack GSoC 2025**: My goal is to contribute to impactful open-source projects and be part of the global GSoC community.
- **Explore SDE roles** at top-tier companies like **Amazon** and **Microsoft**.
  
## 💞️ Collaboration

I'm always open to collaborating on interesting projects, particularly in:
- **Open-source contributions** (MERN stack, Java-based projects, cloud solutions).
- Projects focused on **event management automation** and **traffic control systems**.
- **DSA problem-solving** and exploring efficient algorithms.
